# Mouse Tracker

Here's a video demo https://www.useloom.com/share/47f657f461df42c99166ae609ad22710

### Spec

- Should have a UI where a user can record their mouse, play back recordings, view all previous recordings, delete previous recordings
- Recordings should be at 60fps
- Every recording should have a name
- Once a recording has been taken, it should persist to a database. I should be able to go view all previous recordings and play any of them.
